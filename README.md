# EDA_Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that showcases an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project. The project was completed as part of the coursework for my Data Mining and Data Visualization subject (BDA205) in my Bachelor's Degree in Data Analytics.

## Project Overview (Heart Failure Mortality Risk Analysis)

The objective of this project is to explore and analyze the dataset using various EDA techniques. The analysis includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics
- Visualization of key variables and relationships
- Insights derived from the data

This project is an in-depth analysis of the relationships between various clinical variables and heart failure-related mortality risks. Using a dataset of heart failure patients, the analysis explores the factors that contribute to higher mortality risks and provides actionable recommendations for improving patient outcomes.

The primary objective was to identify key factors that significantly influence the likelihood of heart failure-related death, including age, ejection fraction, serum sodium, and other variables. The project combined both visual and statistical exploration techniques, such as T-tests, Chi-Square tests, and data visualizations, to uncover patterns and associations.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains medical records of 299 heart failure patients, with features such as age, sex, serum creatinine levels, diabetes status, ejection fraction, and death event as the target variable (DEATH_EVENT).

## Results
The analysis provides insights into key patterns and trends in the data, including correlations, distributions, and significant relationships between variables.

## Tools Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`
